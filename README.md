Android app to have a chance at manual Brute force attack 

The use case is when you forgot a password (in my case bios password of a Lenovo Y70)
You don't want to try one password 10 times over a long period so every time I try a password 
I put it in this app and I will know if I have tired it before or not.
Also in the case I succeed in finding password I recieve a congratulation messege.
